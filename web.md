17. ### Simple forums
Difficulty: Intermediate

In order to boost your HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and Javascript skills you need to challenge yourself. You need to be good at all of the above to create a Simple forum.

Task:

This simple forum should be built from the ground up, meaning nothing like bootstrap. It should at least contain a registration form, and a login form. Users should be able to add their username and date of birth, as well as a small bio to their user profiles. They will be able to post in admin created categories, and their posts are threads. Other users should be able to comment on these threads. You should also create an administrative panel to add these sections, and also manage users.

For added complexity:

Include all of the above, but also add panels for recent posts, who's online, a rank manager in the administrative panel and a new rank - moderators. Create a full new panel for them named the moderation panel and allow them to do tasks that you believe they should be allowed to do. Also add a section in the administrative panel for managing individual user's permissions and ranks. Add a Sticky thread button to sections which will basically move the thread up top, and make it so it looks important. Add close, delete, copy and move buttons and add a way to tell if the forum is closed, stickied, read or unread. Make sure to add a way to tell if the user has already read a post, and add a time spent online timer.
