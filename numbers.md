Difficulty: Intermediate

In mathematics, a Kaprekar number for a given base is a non-negative integer, the representation of whose square in that base can be split into two parts that add up to the original number again. For instance, 45 is a Kaprekar number, because 452 = 2025 and 20+25 = 45. The Kaprekar numbers are named after D. R. Kaprekar. Your program will receive two integers per line telling you the start and end of the range to scan, inclusively. Example: '1 50'. Your program should emit the Kaprekar numbers in that range. From the example: 45 is the Kaprekar number in that range. For your program focus only on base 10 numbers. For added complexity, see if you can make it work in arbitrary bases.

28. ### Gray Code
Difficulty: Intermediate

Gray code, so named after discoverer Frank Gray, is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit (binary digit). The reflected binary code was originally designed to prevent spurious output from electromechanical switches. Today, Gray code is widely used to facilitate error correction in digital communications such as digital terrestrial television and some cable TV systems.

Gray code differs from regular binary counting sequences in one key way: because sequential values can have only a single bit difference from their predecessor, you wind up with a non-linear progression of base 10 integers.

IMPORTANT: Read the document linked below as it is important to be able to implement this idea > https://docs.google.com/document/d/17U_sV5wZr-ioHg-llR3xJIoWVh0iJOoq_7bP1DebQeU/edit?usp=sharing

Write a program that can generate a Gray code sequence of a decimal the user inputs. For example, if you were given input = 2 your program should emit:

00
01
11
10 - 2

29. ### Lotto
Difficulty: Beginner

Create a program which asks for 6 numbers in the range 1-49. The program should then display 6 random numbers from the same range. and check how many numbers the user guessed correctly. For added complexity, make the program into a mini-game. Allow the user to retry the lotto, show their payout after each round, their highest payout etc. Feel free to add as much complexity as you want.

30. ### Roman to Arabic numeral converter
Difficulty: Beginner

Create a program that converts Roman numbers (such as MCMLIV) to Arabic numbers (1954) and back.

Roman numerals are read from left to right, as you add or subtract the value of each symbol.

If a value is lower than the following value, it will be subtracted. Otherwise it will be added.

For example, we want to convert the Roman numeral MCMLIV to an Arabic number:

M = 1000 must be added, because the following letter C =100 is lower.
C = 100 must be subtracted because the following letter M =1000 is greater.
M = 1000 must be added, because the following letter L = 50 is lower.
L = 50 must be added, because the following letter I =1 is lower.
I = 1 must be subtracted, because the following letter V = 5 is greater.
V = 5 must be added, because there are no more symbols left.

We can now calculate the number:
1000 - 100 + 1000 + 50 - 1 + 5 = 1954

31. ### Circular Primes
Difficulty: Intermediate

A number is a circular prime if all of its cycles are also primes.

To cycle a number just take its first digit and stick it on its end. For example, 197 -> 971 -> 719 -> 197.

Make a program that takes in a input of a number and outputs if the given number is a circular prime. The output should look something like:

INPUT 197 -> OUTPUT [971 -> 719 -> 197] - Valid/Invalid

For added complexity, allow the program to accept two numbers and output all the circular primes between them, inclusive. You could choose to format the output for each circular prime just like in the example above. Also you could try to do the cycling part purely mathematically - without converting to a string and slicing it.

32. ### Pseudo-Random Number Generator
Difficulty: Intermediate

A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), also known as a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) is an algorithm for generating a sequence of numbers whose properties approximate the properties of sequences of random numbers. The PRNG-generated sequence is not truly random, because it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values, called the PRNG's seed (which may include truly random values).

Make your own (pseudo) random number generator. Accept input from the user specifying the number of random numbers to generate and the PRNG seed. Output a list of pseudo-random numbers.

33. ### Friday the 13th
Difficulty: Intermediate

The user enters a year amd your program should output the number and dates of Friday the 13th in that given year. Try not to rely on any Time library like for example in Ruby — Time() class and make your own methods or functions for that.

To make it more complex, try to input not only the year but any given dates with starting Date(Month, Day, Year) and End Date and ouput if there is an existing one.

For example,

Input: 2017

Output:
January 13, 2017
October 13, 2017

Input: 04/14/2017 - 07/14/2018 (mm/dd/yyyy)

Output:
October 13, 2017
April 13, 2018
July 13, 2018

34. ### Latin Squares
Difficulty: Beginner

A Latin square is an n x n array filled with n different symbols each occuring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.

For example
1

And,
1  2
2  1

are both valid Latin squares.

For this program you have to check whether a given array is a Latin square. If it is a Latin square, then display true otherwise display false.

The user will provide two inputs:
1. n - The length of a row in the array
2. A string representing the array of symbols

Example input

5
1 2 3 4 5 5 1 2 3 4 4 5 1 2 3 3 4 5 1 2 2 3 4 5 1
2
1 3 3 4

Example output

true
false
false
