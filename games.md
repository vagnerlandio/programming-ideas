5. ### Connect Four

6. ### Nibbles
Difficulty: Intermediate

A worm or snake constantly moves around the board. The player controls the direction the "head" of the worm moves, and the worm must try to eat apples that randomly appear. Eating an apply causes the worm to grow in length. The game ends if the worm crashes into the edge of the board or into itself.
7. ### Chess and Checkers

Difficulty: Intermediate

Players put down their X or O symbol on a 3x3 board and try to get three in a row.

9. ### Maze

11. ### Typespeed
Difficulty: Intermediate

A typing game where words slowly move to the right side of the screen. The player must type the word to make them disappear. The player loses after enough words hit the right side of the screen.

12. ### Game of Threes
Difficulty: Expert

The user enters a single number like 100 and your program repeatedly does the following:
1. If the number is divisible by 3, divide it by 3.
2. If it is not, either add or subtract 1  to make it divisible by three then divide it by 3.
The game stops when the number reaches three. Your program's output should be the list of valid steps taken to arrive at the final answer 1. For the number 100, 100 -1 33 0 11 1 4 1 would be the valid output.

13. ### Words with Enemies
Difficulty: Intermediate

There is a valley. On each side there are two cannons firing words at each other. In the middle of the valley the words make contact and explode. Similar letters from each word cancel each other out and the leftover falls into the valley and fills it up. Make a Player1 versus CPU program that generates a word to counter the user's own. For example, user inputs 'held', CPU randomly generates 'jelly'. E cancels out. Player1 has 3 characters left (H,L,D), CPU has 4 characters left (J,L,L,Y) so CPU wins. Make your AI fair so the game is enjoyable.

14. ### Connect Four 2
Difficulty: Expert

There's a 4*4 square playing area. Two players take turns putting their signs in any one of the 16 squares in the playing area. A player wins when ever there are four of his signs in a row. The row could either be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.

16. ### CMD RPG
Difficulty: Beginner

A role-playing game (RPG) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Create a command line style RPG game, which has multiple actions the user can perform, in different locations and scenarios. At the very least, the player should encounter monsters, engage in quests, buy items in a shop and save the game for later.

17. ### Dodger
Difficulty: Intermediate

Several bad guys fall from the top of the screen and move randomly around the screen(to make it more challenging, some bad guys may follow the main character trying to kill him), and the user must avoid them. The player can either be controlled with the arrow keys or more directly with the mouse. The longer the player lasts without being killed, the higher the score. For every 3 minutes, the game gets more challenging.

20. ### Horse Racing Betting
Difficulty: Intermediate

The player starts with a certain amount of money (eg. Â£100) and then gets to bet on horse races. Before a race, the stats and probability of each horse is shown to let the player bet a certain amount on that race. At the end of the race (after the results have been randomly generated), either add the money or notify the player of their loss.
The player could win/lose when they have a certain amount of money.
The game should probably have slightly better odds than what they would be in real life to allow the player to do well.
For added complexity, a GUI could be created or even a live view of the horses as they race.
